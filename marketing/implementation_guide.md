Great question! I designed it to be super simple:

Takes literally 5 minutes. I've included step-by-step screenshots and even troubleshooting guides. Let me know if you get stuck - happy to help! 🚀

That's it! Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The setup script handles all dependencies automatically. Even installs FFmpeg for you on Windows!
